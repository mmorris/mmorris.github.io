<p>Google is right to attack Apple on this front. My mother has a 16G iPhone, no desktop computer, and no broadband at her home. This is our procedure for getting pictures off her iPhone.</p>
<ol>
<li>She brings an iPhone cable to work whenever she can.</li>
<li>Her photos &#038; video are uploaded to iCloud Photo Library over her work&#8217;s WiFi.</li>
<li>I manually download them and put them in her Dropbox.</li>
<li>I delete them from her iCloud Photo Library, and they disappear from her phone.
</ol>
<p>Talk about jumping through hoops.</p>

<p>I collaborated with <a href="https://twitter.com/DrHughHarvey">Dr. Hugh Harvey</a> to build this Chrome extension. It changes words and phrases on news articles about the UK&#8217;s NHS budget crisis to highlight the issue of drastic underfunding.</p>
<p>Some backstory from the description,</p>
<blockquote><p>The NHS is undergoing the largest chronic underfunding period in its 70 year history. The Department of Health (and thus the media) tend to blame this on hospitals and staff, as if it were their fault. In reality there simply isn’t enough money provided by the Treasury to provide the services that are needed, with staff overstretched, waiting lists increasing and patient care suffering in quality.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a US citizen, I don&#8217;t really have any skin in this game. But from my experience doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers on the &#8220;front lines&#8221; do their level best, with the resources available, to provide the best care to as many patients as possible.</p>
