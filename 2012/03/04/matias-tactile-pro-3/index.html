<div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">Apple Wireless Keyboard</a> for some time now. I really liked it when I first started using it, but recently I&rsquo;ve become dissatisfied with it for various reasons. I&rsquo;ve even started to blame it for some pain I&rsquo;ve been having in my finger joints. So, a few weeks ago I decided to try a 3rd party Mac keyboard. I ordered a <a href="http://amzn.to/I4uB3o">Tactile Pro 3</a>, and here are my thoughts.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What&rsquo;s Wrong with the Apple Aluminum Keyboard?</h2>

<p>My biggest complaint about the Apple keyboards is that the keys have a short &ldquo;travel time.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;travel time&rdquo; to mean the time between the instant a finger begins pressing a key to the time that a character is registered by the system. The current line of Apple keyboards have very short keys, and it requires a very short press to register a keystrike.</p>

<p>I know that many pepole like a short travel time because it enables them to touch type very fast. For me, the net effect is that it often feels like I&rsquo;m slamming my fingers on the desk. I&rsquo;ve started to attribute this to some aches and pains that I&rsquo;ve recently felt in my finger joints.</p>

<p>My next complaint is that it&rsquo;s very narrow, and very light. Because it&rsquo;s so narrow, it&rsquo;s not easy for me to use it on my lap. I have to force my legs together so that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not constantly slipping.</p>

<h2>Matias Tactile Pro 3</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/I4uB3o">Tactile Pro 3</a> is a full sized Mac keyboard. It has 15 physical function keys, volume buttons, and a num pad. It also touts three high-speed USB 2 ports that are capable of delivering power to other peripherals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewmorris/6963469393/lightbox"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7182/6963469393_43dd24cfeb_z.jpg" width="640" height="256" title="Tactile Pro 3" alt="Tactile Pro 3"></a></p>

<p>I got the Silver and Black &ndash; Limited Edition, and I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with how it looks. I&rsquo;m also happy to find that its USB cable is long enough to reach around to my tower without having to use an extension. And we&rsquo;re all aware of Apple&rsquo;s spitefully non-compatible USB extension cables.</p>

<h2>The Keys</h2>

<p>This keyboard has much taller keys than the Apple keyboards. I&rsquo;d say 5-6 times the height. This provides a longer keypress &ldquo;travel time&rdquo; and gives the typing center of my brain a chance to get ready to pullback from the keypress. I also like they way that the keys press &ldquo;up&rdquo; against your finger during the entire keystroke. Also, the tops of the keys are concave, which does seem to help me keep my hands in the right position.</p>

<h2>Wide-ness</h2>

<p>With the arrow keys set aside from the letter keys and the numpad off to the right, this keyboard is much wider than the Apple wireless keyboard. I don&rsquo;t have to hold my legs and arms so awkwardly together when using it in my lap. The downside to this is that it takes up more real estate on my desk, which is often inhabited by two laptops, two widescreen monitors, and an external hard drive.</p>

<h2>Clickety Clickety Clack!</h2>

<p>The Tactile Pro 3 is, if nothing else, loud. A keypress makes several distinct sounds as you press. I like this because it&rsquo;s more signaling that my brain can use in determining the right moment to release a key and move on.  I find that I am able to do a softer keypress even when I&rsquo;m typing at full speed. But more than that, it&rsquo;s just really really fun to work on a clicky keyboard.  Maybe this is just nostalga for the Apple II or Apple Extended.</p>

<p>The big potential downside of the loudness is that it might be distracting to your office mate, or even to coworkers several dozen meters down the hall. This is something that I sometimes worry about, and I&rsquo;m still trying to decide if I should buy my office mate a pair of noice cancelling headphones.</p>

<blockquote><p>I say your colleagues should learn to love your loud keyboard. It&#8217;s a sign that you&#8217;re hard at work. &#8220;Hey Dave&#8217;s working, listen to Dave&#8230; Holy hell, Dave&#8217;s getting some shit done, I&#8217;m gonna get back to work.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>John Gruber, The Talk Show #81</strong> <cite><a href='http://5by5.tv/talkshow/81'>5by5.tv/talkshow/81/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Other Niceties</h2>

<ul>
<li>Laser Etched Keys (should show less wear than painted)</li>
<li>Symbols and Special Characters are also on the key surface</li>
<li>No limit on the number of simultaneous keystrokes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Negatives?</h2>

<p>There are a few keys at the edge of the keyboard which sometimes exhibit additional friction while the key is being pressed down. I suspect that it&rsquo;s because my hand is far from the key, and as a result my finger is not striking the key at an angle perpendicular to the keyboard&rsquo;s back plane. I&rsquo;m exerting some force to the side, and it&rsquo;s causing the key to rub against the housing a little. But this doesn&rsquo;t bother me too often, and maybe with some practice I can develop the muscle memory to avoid it completely.</p>

<p>Lastly, the frame isn&rsquo;t quite as solid and heavy as I would consider ideal. If you&rsquo;re keyboard isn&rsquo;t the first thing you grab when a home intruder is kicking down your door, you may have the wrong keyboard.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>At 150 USD, this isn&rsquo;t a trivial purchase. But if you&rsquo;re a professional that uses a keyboard all day, day and night, all year round, then it&rsquo;s really not that much to spend on the right tools. And even if there&rsquo;s no <strong>real</strong> speed increase with a clicky keyboard, I still feel it&rsquo;s worth it to have tools that aren&rsquo;t a daily annoyance.</p>
