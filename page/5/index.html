<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass,_West_Virginia">Cass</a> is a small town in the mountains of West Virginia. Formerly a company logging town, Cass offers a chance for a relaxing weekend getaway. And free from the burdens of broadband and cellular reception, you can be sure that your enjoyment of the trains will never be interrupted by blips and boops from your smartphone.</p>
<p>If you have a young child that loves trains, I highly recommend it.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">Building a Web Backend from Scratch</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>I built the backend for my last project on Heroku using Sinatra. It was great; I got to learn about Ruby and a new web framework and it was a very stable and fast API.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about what to use for my next project when I saw Marco’s <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers">Web Hosting for App Developers</a> and the ensuing discussions among developers on Twitter. After giving it some thought I came to the conclusion that I could probably learn alot by self-hosting the backend myself. Maybe I can even build something as stable and reliable as what I built on Heroku?</p>
<p>Rebuild, Rebuild, Rebuild</p>
<p>I made the decision up-front to script the entire process of building the server. This way, in the event of a network outage at Linode or in the unlikely event that my app comes under heavy load, I can add new servers in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>My current scripts do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup SSH keys and disable SSH password authentication</li>
<li>Setup firewall, leaving only ports for my application open.</li>
<li>Install git, postgres, golang, and other software used by my application.</li>
<li>Configure postgres and golang</li>
<li>Checkout the application code from my repository</li>
<li>Configure it so that it automatically starts when the system reboots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I miss anything?</p>
<p>Another thing that I do to make sure that my scripts are always in working order is to rebuild the server every time I make a substantial change to the script. Also, I completely rebuild the server every evening I sit down to work on it. This leaves me feeling pretty confident that I can quickly recover from a serious outage.</p>
<p>Now, you might have noticed that I mentioned golang above. I’d originally planned to use Flask, but as I already have some experience with Python, I chose Golang so that I can learn something new. The dowside of this will be that Go isn’t as widely used, and I will be navigating uncharted water without the usual wealth of online sample code and SO Q&#038;A. Still, my early impressions of Martini + Golang are very positive. I’m hopeful that I can get everything working withough too much headache.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>I need to setup automatic database backups. I’ll probably use a cron job that automatically sends raw backups to Amazon S3. Also, I’d like to support HTTPS for all API calls. Since I’m just building a web API for my own app, I can just be my own Certificate Authority and issue my own SSL certificates and keys. Any problem with that?</p>
<p>Have any comments or suggestions? <a href="https://twitter.com/boxel">Let me know</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">Charting Dividend Reinvestment</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>I recently wanted to see a graph of a particular stock assuming dividend reinvestment. This seems like it would be a common thing to do, but neither Google nor Yahoo&#8217;s finance sites appear to have the capability. After a bit of searching, I found a way to do it.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-105 aligncenter" src="http://104.236.129.96/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aapl-div-2-300x184.png" alt="aapl-div-2" width="700" srcset="https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aapl-div-2-300x184.png 300w, https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aapl-div-2-768x472.png 768w, https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aapl-div-2-1024x630.png 1024w, https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/aapl-div-2.png 1236w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>So here, I&#8217;ve plotted $AAPL over the past two years with and without dividend reinvestment. Note that $AAPL first paid a divident in Augustof 2012, so it&#8217;s logical that the graph begins to diverge shortly after that. Currently the difference in return is about 4.3% over the two years.1</p>
<p>You can fiddle with this graph yourself. Or, starting from scratch, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a chart for AAPL</li>
<li>Set the range (above I used 2 years)</li>
<li>Set &#8220;Type&#8221; to Thin Line (optional)</li>
<li>In both the Overlays and Indicators sections, click &#8220;Clear All&#8221;</li>
<li>Under Indicators, create a Price/Performance indicator with parameter _AAPL and set &#8220;Position&#8221; to &#8220;Behind Price&#8221;.</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Update&#8221;Interestingly, <a href="http://www.stockcharts.com/">stockcharts.com</a> appears to assume dividend reinvestment by default, while Google Finance and Yahoo Finance do not.</li>
</ol>

		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>For the past five years, I have worked in a traditional office. A few weeks ago, I moved a thousand miles across the country and became a telecommuter. Several months before the move, I started gathering material to try to help me prepare for the new work situation. Here are a few I found useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.70decibels.com/homework/">Home Work</a> is an excellent podcast examines the ins and outs of telecommuting and freelancing. I’m not a freelancer, so I cherry picked the episodes that seemed most relevant to me. If you’re currently an office worker but think you might like to try working from home, check out <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/homework/2012/9/21/027-telecommuting-basics.html">Episode 27 – Telecommuting Basics</a> and <a href="http://(http://www.70decibels.com/homework/2013/4/19/055-telecommuting.html">Episode 55 – Telecommuting</a>.
<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-beginners-guide-to-working-from-home-733412770">The Beginner’s Guide to Working from Home</a> is a recent article that has several good tips for a new home worker.

</ul>
<p>Here’s my core advice to anyone about to start telecommuting for the first time. Give some proactive thought and planning to your home office setup, your work/life schedule and boundaries, and your effectiveness as a communicator. Also, try to be aware of what distractions are most problematic for you and take steps to minimize them.</p>

			<a href="../../2012/07/29/interception/index.html">
			<h2 class="post-title">Interception</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>Late last week, I finally got around to setting up Twitter as an account on Mountain Lion. I was disappointed to see that clicking a Twitter notification launches the default web browser and not Twitter.app or any other client. I do not enjoy using Twitter&#8217;s web interface, so I wrote a simple application that forwards these clicks to a native Twitter application of your choice.</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>If this sounds like something that you would find useful, <a href="http://bit.ly/RjnPQz">download the beta</a> and give it a try. The application is a single dialog that asks for your preferred Twitter client. Click &#8216;Okay&#8217; and you&#8217;re all set. There should be no need to run the app again unless you want to switch to a different client.</p>
<p><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2012/07/interception_ui.png" alt="interception_ui" width="564" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-210" srcset="https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/interception_ui.png 564w, https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/interception_ui-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" /></p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This software should be considered very &#8220;beta.&#8221; If things get weird and you find you can&#8217;t open http URLs anymore or something like that, just delete the .app and <a href="let%20me%20know.html">http://www.twitter.com/boxel</a>.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Interception registers itself as the default handler the URLs that are invoked when you click on a Twitter notification. If it notices a Twitter URL is being loaded by Launch Services, it catches the request and forwards it to the native twitter client you have chosen. All other URLs are silently passed as-is to the default web browser. A previous version of Interception set itself as the default http URL handler for the system, but this is no longer necessary.</p>
<h2>Known Issues and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Interception currently supports only the following Twitter clients:  </p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot_mac/">Tweetbot for Mac</a><br />
&#8211; Twitter.app<br />
&#8211; Tweet Deck<br />
&#8211; <a href="http://hibariapp.com/">Hibari</a></p>
<p>Currently Interception is just hard-coded with the bundle identifiers for each of these apps. In a future version, I might add a &#8220;Choose App&#8221; button which would let the user. If your favorite native Twitter client is not one of these four, please let me know.    </p>
<p>Also, Twitter mentions and direct messages should land the user on different views inside the targeted Twitter app. I began to wire this up, but it seems that the Tweetbot for Mac public alpha is not yet honoring the <a href="http://tapbots.com/blog/development/tweetbot-url-scheme">Tweetbot URL Scheme</a>, so I put that functionality on hold for all clients. Tweetbot is awesome, and this will be the next feature I add. </p>
<p>I have created a <a href="https://github.com/mmorris/Interception">project</a> over on Github where I will host the code. I have not posted it yet for two reasons. First, I did this in a bit of a hurry and I would like to clean up the code before I throw it out into the wild. Second, if our local Cocoaheads chapter gets going in the next month or two, I might like to present the project at a meeting and then release the source code and slides all at the same time.</p>
<h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/RjnPQz">Download It Here</a>. Feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>I realize that if you&#8217;re favorite Twitter client is in the Mac App Store, it can use push notifications in Mountain Lion, in which case Interception won&#8217;t really be that useful. I&#8217;ve really been enoying Tweetbot for Mac, but it&#8217;s currently in alpha and doesn&#8217;t yet support remote push notifications. This application grew out of a script I wrote because I wanted to be able to launch Tweetbot from a notification even if Tweetbot wasn&#8217;t already running.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;ve lost track of how many times I typed &#8220;Inception&#8221; while writing this post.</p>

		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>Two months ago, in preparation for LASIK eye surgery, I searched the internet for accounts of people’s experiences with the procedure. I found a wide variety of results, most of which were positive. Since I didn’t find anything from the point of view of a professional programmer, I will leave my account here.</p>
<h2>The Facts</h2>
<p>Pre-surgery, I was highly myopic with a prescription of -8.75 in both eyes.<br />
Pre-surgery, my vision was correctable to 20/15 (better than 20/20)<br />
Date of surgery: May 30th, 2012 @ 7:30am<br />
Post-surgery prescription, measured the day after surgery:<br />
I’m told that –.25 is effectively 20/20.</p>
<h2>My Daily Routine</h2>
<p>I believe that how you use your eyes every day is an important factor to consider when thinking about LASIK. For someone in a career that requires almost constant use of a computer, having clear and reliable vision is very important. To give a clearer picture of my results and whether or not you can draw any conclusions from my impressions, here is a rough outline of my typical day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Awake at 5:45
<li>Leave house by 6:45
<li>40+ minute commute
<li>At work: 8+ hours of programming
<li>Workout during lunch
<li>40+ minute commute
<li>Dinner + family time.
<li>Once kids are asleep: 4+ hours of programming on personal projects.
</ul>
<p>(Note: This is the fullest possible schedule. I can’t pull this off every day.)</p>
<p>During the pre-surgery interviews with the surgeon, I explained that I am a professional programmer and asked if I could be expected to return to work the next day. Answer: yes.</p>
<h2>The Surgery</h2>
<p>The surgery itself was not a big deal. It was a little uncomfortable at one point when a suction device is attached to the eye, but that didn’t last long. When I first got up from the opterating table, everything appeared as if I were underwater. This was, in fact, because there is actually fluid in the eye that drains away over the next 24-48 hours.</p>
<h2>Recovery, Day 0</h2>
<p>After the surgery, I was driven home by a family member. There was no pain, but my vision was cloudy and I would have been unable to drive. My two boys were at home with a babysitter. Once home, I attempted to close my eyes and rest, at the recommendation of the surgeon.</p>
<p>Later that day there was more discomfort, but my vision was already beginning to clear. I cooked the boys dinner and got them ready for bed with no problem.</p>
<p>Once they were asleep in bed, I sat down at the computer to check my email and maybe try to work on some of my apps. I was barely able to read email.Needless to say, I was a little concerned, since I was scheduled to return to work the next day. But I decided not to worry about it for the time being, hoping that 8 hours of sleep would give my eyes time to rest and recover.</p>
<h2>Recovery, Day 1: Halos</h2>
<p>The next day I realized that I was seeing the dreaded “halo” effect that I had read about online. Around every light source, I saw a very noticeable ring of light. It turns out that this didn’t really bother me when I was doing most “normal” activities. Computer screens, however, turned out to be a problem. They emit light, and when reading text on screen, each character produced its own halo, and every halo overlapped with the ones adjacent to it. This created an unbearable blurring effect that made it very difficult to read on-screen text.</p>
<p>In fact, I went in for a 24 hour followup that day. My prescription was measured using a autorefractor, and my vision was determined to be very close to 20/20. However, I was almost completely unable to read the letters on the eye chart. The eye chart appeared to be an LCD backlit display, and this was producing haloing effects around the letters.</p>
<p>I did manage to get to work that day. However, it was frustrating because I had to place the screens mere inches from my face and increase the font in Xcode to rediculous sizes. It was so large that I suspected people could read my code from the hallway by my office.</p>
<h2>Recovery, Week 1</h2>
<p>The halo effect persisted well into the first week. It was still difficult to read a computer screen, but I found that if I used the lubricant eye drops recommended by the doctor, it helped a great deal. Yes, the drops temporarily cleared my vision. I found that if I used the drops every 45 minutes or so, I could code the whole day without getting too frustrated.</p>
<h2>One Month Later</h2>
<p>At times I still have to use the lubricant eye drops in order to use a computer, but my vision has gradually improved to the point that I sometimes go several hours without having to do so.</p>
<p>I’ve been asked several times how satisfied I am with the procedure. I think that if I had any type of job that doesn’t require reading code on a screen for 10+ hours a day, I would be 99% satisfied. As this is not the case, I would probably say that I am 85% satisfied.</p>
<p>To this date, I still feel that my vision continues to improve. If you’ve recently had LASIK and are concerned because your vision is still blurry, your eyes may still be healing. Try not to worry.</p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Close your eyes and rest as much as possible on the first day. I think I tried to do too much that first day and I wonder if it slowed my recovery.<br />
If you experience halos and have trouble reading a computer screen, try the lubricant eye drops.<br />
Use them frequently, even if the dryness doesn’t bother you.<br />
Try to schedule a short vacation from work beginning the day of your surgery. If this is not possible, try to schedule the surgery right before a 3-day weekend. Reading a computer screen as part of a demanding job was stressful during these first days, but driving, cooking, playing with the kids, etc. was not a problem at all. Drive to the coast and get some rest.</p>
<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>Radial Keratotomy, a predecessor to the LASIK procedure, was discovered by accident after a young boy fell off his bycicle and broke his glasses. Some time after the doctor had removed the shards of glass from his eye, his visual acuity had improved. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_keratotomy#Development">source</a>]</p>

		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>Well, Lesley and I are back from Mexco City, and we had a great time. Mexico is a very colorful country with an interesting history. We stayed in Hostal Moneda which is just two blocks from the cathedral in El Centro Histórico. This month, there happened to be a market set up in the area around the cathedral, and the street to our hostal was closed. On my first day there, I saw six guys punching and kicking a guy as he lay in the street. Well, that sort of put me on edge for a while, so to relax I went to a family run restaurant nearby and had some chicken with Mole sauce: a traditional dish. </p>
<p>Lesley arrived the next day and I picked her up from the airport. We went back to the hotstal and looked around the area a bit more. That night we went to a really shnazzy authentic restaurant just a few blocks north of the Cathedral. </p>
<p>The next day was her friend&#8217;s consecration. We took a cab to <a href="http://www.anahuac.mx/">La Universidad de Anáhuac</a> and, after convincing the guards to let us in, walked up to the church. The chapel overlooks a large cliff with a valley at the bottom. There were many trees and you could see for miles; a breathtaking view. </p>
<p>Slowly people started to file in. Lesley and I conversed with a legionarian for about 30 min. His name was Hernán, I think. He went to the seminary at age 11. We shared some personal stories about our lives and talked about Mexico and the cerimony that was about to take place. Once inside I noticed the crucifix. It was very realistic, and was a bit distracting at first. I counted 45 priests as they entered, and there were even more seminarians and consecrated. The mass was beautiful, especially the homily, most of which I understood thanks to the celebrant&#8217;s calm, clear diction. </p>
<p>First, those who had already taken their promises/vows made a renewal. Then, Lesley&#8217;s friend Evan and the other young men went up to the altar one by one to make a promise of obedience, poverty, and chastity. It was a very powerful moment. </p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day with Evan and his family. Ron, our consecrated tour-guide, took us to a nice place for some eats, and we chatted away the afternoon. (I had Chiles en Nogada, a wonderful Mexican delicacy!) </p>
<p>The rest of the trip we spent with Evan and his family, seeing the sights of Mexico City. Monday we went to the Bascilica at Our Lady of Guadalupe. The following day we went to the old presidential palace and the museum in the downtown area. There is some beautiful art and many fascinating pieces of Mexican history to be seen there. </p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s good to be back home I guess. I&#8217;m sure there will be more adventures to come. </p>
