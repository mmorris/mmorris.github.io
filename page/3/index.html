<p>I attended a middle school that housed all of 7th and 8th grade within a single open classroom. It was a large, cavernous room that held almost two dozen classes only separated by a 4ft high wall. Hundreds of students were within earshot of each other. In the picture above, take a look at the ceiling lights and you can get a sense of how far back it goes.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, these open classrooms1 started taking off in the 70s and were dying off by the early 90s. I wonder what choices led to this design. Was it based on some educational theory or was it just cost effective? Either way, why did it go out of fashion? Were there lessons learned that can be applied to today&#8217;s debate about open office plans?</p>

<p>When your child undergoes a serious surgery or is seriously ill, stress comes at you from all directions. Will she be able to lead a normal live? Will anything go wrong during the surgery? Will my insurance company pay for all of this?</p>
<p>But what if the only hospital that can help you is several hours away? Imagine having to unexpectedly feed and house a family of five for such a long period of time. Hotel and restaurant expenses add up quickly. Sometimes families are faced with a choice: endure financial hardship, or split up the family for months at a time.</p>
<p>The Ronald McDonald House is a charity whose mission is to provide some relief in this situation. If your child is hospitalized away from your home town, they will provide you with a room, two comfortable beds, and two or more meals each day. This is a tremendous relief for families dealing with a whirlwind of stress, worry, and pain.</p>
<p>We were fortunate that there is a Ronald McDonald House in Charleston, where we have now stayed for a total of two months. It&#8217;s a warm and welcoming place, a home-away from home where we can take a break from the hospital bedside, take a break from the stress, and find a little peace.</p>
<p>If you have any end-of-year giving left to do, please consider donating to the Ronald McDonald House. I&#8217;m not sure that we could have survived the past few months without them.</p>

		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>Sebastian will be discharged soon. He&#8217;s recovering well from the surgery, and we&#8217;re looking forward to having the entire family under one roof again. It&#8217;s been very difficult, but it&#8217;s almost over.</p>
<p>The doctors say that we&#8217;ll have to be very careful during the winter flu season. Most kids can weather <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/rsv/">RSV</a> or a common virus with no problem. But we&#8217;re told that Sebastian has limited &#8220;pulmonary reserve&#8221; and any winter illness might send him back to the hospital. So, they&#8217;ve advised us to take him out in public as little as possible, and he absolutely cannot attend daycare.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I&#8217;ve decided to take a year off from consulting to keep my son at home. After his next open-heart surgery, we should be able to treat him like a normal kid, but for now we have to be a little careful.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">My Gif Workflow</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>I&#8217;ve been doing more consulting recently and have therefore been thrust into various Slack teams. While collaborating with my colleagues, I have learned one thing: GIFs are the lingua franca of technical communication.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m a little late to the party with respect to the GIF movement, but I thought I&#8217;d share the workflow that I cooked up this afternoon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-66 size-full" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/05/thumbs-up-troy.gif" alt="thumbs-up-troy" width="500" height="234" /></p>
<p>On iOS, I grabbed GIFwrapped and started building a small GIF collection. GIFWrapped lets you search for GIFs and then lets you save them to your Dropbox under /Apps/GIFWrapped. Nifty.</p>
<p>On OS X, I wanted to be able to use that same collection Dropbox and share links in Slack and on Twitter. To get the raw file URLs from Dropbox, you have to put them in Dropbox/Public. So, I moved the GIF files into in Dropbox/Public/Gifs and created a symlink to it inside Dropbox/Apps/GIFwrapped. (Luckily GIFwrapped recursively searches its folder for GIF files)</p>
<p>Next, I needed a way to quickly search for a gif and grab the Dropbox URL. I made this quick Automator workflow that does the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompts for a search string.</li>
<li>Does a Spotlight search inside the Gifs folder.</li>
<li>Displays a list of GIFs matching the search.</li>
<li>Copies the Dropbox URL to the pasteboard after you&#8217;ve chosen.</li>
<li>Displays a notification so that you know the URL is ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>I bound the workflow to a keyboard shortcut and now I can deploy GIFs at a moment&#8217;s notice. If you&#8217;d like to give it a try, grab the automator workflow and give it a try. You&#8217;ll just need to modify the dropbox_url in the AppleScript and make sure that the various paths are correct for your system.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">Using an iPhone with no Cell Plan</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>For several months, I have been using my iPhone without a cellular plan.1 I cancelled my service last summer when I left my full-time job and began dropping monthly expenses in an effort to tighten up the household budget.</p>
<p>All in all, I haven&#8217;t missed the cell plan too much. I am covered by WiFi 95% of the time, and rarely miss cellular. I&#8217;m covered at home, and almost everywhere I go on a weekly basis. This includes my local grocery store, Sam&#8217;s Club, the public library, our church, and my kids&#8217; favorite playground. I have Comcast business internet connection, so when there&#8217;s no free public WiFi to be found, I can use my credentials to hop on one of the various &#8220;xfinity&#8221; WiFi nodes around town.</p>
<p>I use FaceTime Audio whenever possible for calling friends and family. If I need to make or receive a &#8220;real&#8221; phone call, I use my Google Voice number with the Hangouts app. Incoming calls appear as a push notification which I swipe to jump straight into the call. And these days, asynchronous messages such as texts and email have cut way back on the amount of calls I make.</p>
<p>Though, there a few many downsides to this system that I must mention. I can&#8217;t ask Siri to make a call using Hangouts.app. If I&#8217;m listening to a podcast and my phone is in my pocket, I can&#8217;t answer Hangout calls using the earbud&#8217;s &#8220;clicker.&#8221; I can&#8217;t make calls directly from Contacts.app. If I have Do Not Disturb enabled, my VIP contacts can&#8217;t reach me by calling my Google Voice number. For me, this means that when my wife is working a night shift, I can&#8217;t use DND and expect to receive a call from her.</p>
<p>Also, the incoming call notifications in Hangouts.app don&#8217;t show the caller&#8217;s name even if I have her in my contacts. This means that I have had to begin remembering everyone&#8217;s phone number if I want to screen calls. Party like it&#8217;s 1995.</p>
<p>Here are a few items I&#8217;d like to see in iOS to make things a little easier to live without a cell plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Siri API for 3rd party apps. Specifically, I want to be able to say something like, &#8220;Call my wife using Google Hangouts.&#8221;
<li>VIP and Do Not Disturb integration. If my wife, a VIP, calls me in a VoIP app, I would like to receive the notificaiton even if I have Do Not Disturb enabled.
<li>The ability to jump from Contacts.app to any other VoIP app.
<p><strong>Update</strong>: When my wife became pregnant, she convinced me to get a SIM so that I would be reachable at all times. I bought a Ting SIM, and simply keep cellular data turned off iPhone-wide. Shameless referral link. This costs only $6/month, and gives me the option of receiving an emergency call from my wife at any time.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I use WiFi, even for phone calls, and carry a Ting SIM for emergency situations.</p>

							<p>Every weekday, I work at <a href="http://www.soco-work.com/">SOCO</a>, a fantastic coworking space. It&#8217;s a great space for working, with high ceilings, wooden floors, and great natural light. And it has a great &#8220;vibe&#8221; because it&#8217;s always full of great people working hard at what they do.</p>
<p>SOCO will soon be expanding to other locations, one of which is a <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article13726727.html">soon-to-be restored</a> historic building in the heart of the former S.C. State Hospital campus. Yesterday, we got a little tour of our new offices. There&#8217;s quite a bit of work to be done, but I can&#8217;t wait to see what they do with these old buildings.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the <a href="_https_/www.flickr.com/photos/matthewmorris/sets/72157656956143811.html">full album</a>. I wish I had brought a &#8220;real&#8221; camera.</p>

<p>I wrote a simple complication for the Apple Watch that tracks gestational age, remaining time to full term, and due date. I keep a close eye on these metrics since we have yet to have a baby reach term.</p>
<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/mmorris/GestationComplication">available here</a>. It uses Objective-C because, as of this writing, complications written in Swift work only in the simulator.</p>
