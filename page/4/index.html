<p>I wrote a simple complication for the Apple Watch that tracks gestational age, remaining time to full term, and due date. I keep a close eye on these metrics since we have yet to have a baby reach term.</p>
<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/mmorris/GestationComplication">available here</a>. It uses Objective-C because, as of this writing, complications written in Swift work only in the simulator.</p>

		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>Shortly before moving to South Carolina last month, our unborn son was diagnosed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetralogy_of_Fallot">Tetralogy of Fallot</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_atresia">Pulmonary Atresia</a>. In order to survive, he will require two open-heart surgeries shortly after birth, a number of weeks in the ICU, and then additional procedures throughout his life. Additionally, he is at risk for a chromosomal abnormality known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiGeorge_syndrome">DiGeorge syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that my wife experiences preterm labor with every pregnancy, including this one. If a baby is born early enough, she will need intensive care in a neonatal ICU in order to thrive.</p>
<p>Our son&#8217;s due date is September 17th, but last month my wife started having strong, regular contractions every 3 minutes. She was admitted to the local hospital and then quickly sent by ambulance to The <a href="http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/musc/">Medical University of South Carolina</a>, two hours away. We spent the weekend in the hospital, and thankfully they were able to stop the contractions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re over the initial shock now and feel very hopeful about his outlook. And see that wavy spot on his head? That&#8217;s hair.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">My Next Project Is an iOS Mail Client</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a mail client for iOS. Though, it&#8217;s not the kind you&#8217;re thinking of. My next app, Hipstamail, lets you write a letter and send it through the US Mail. You type the letter in a vintage typewriter font, enter payment information, tap send, and I&#8217;ll mail your letter for you.</p>
<p>Why on earth did I build this? Well, I have a family member that is in a particular situation. Due to her job, my sister cannot receive or send email, text messages, or phone calls. She can only receive physical letters in the mail, and can only send me a letter every month or so. Can you guess what her &#8220;job&#8221; is? 1</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been pretty horrible at remembering to write her on a regular basis. Apparently keeping envelopes and stamps in the house is too much for me to handle. So, how great would it be to to have the ability to jot off a quick message and send it to her from my iPhone?</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what I have built. I have no reason to believe it will be a huge success, but who knows, maybe there&#8217;s someone else out there that might find it useful. Initially, my goal is just for the project to be cashflow positive. 2</p>
<p>Whenever I start a new side project, I take the opportunity to force myself to learn something new. This time, I <a href="../../2014/08/01/building-a-web-backend-from-scratch/index.html">built the backend from scratch</a> and wrote the server application in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. Credit cards are processed by <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, and letters are sent by <a href="https://lob.com/">Lob</a>. It&#8217;s also my first time making serious use of Auto Layout.</p>
<p>I plan to start betas by the end of November, and release the app by the end of 2014. If you&#8217;re interesting in trying out the beta3, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/boxel">say hello</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">The Story of How I Broke My Leg</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>In high school, I ran middle distance for the school track team. I competed in the 800m dash and the 4x800m relay. As I remember it, my training routine consisted of 1hr road runs three days a week, and interval training on the track two or three days a week.</p>
<p>One weekend, I got it into my head that it would be really cool to run around town. By that I mean, literally all the way around town. Early one Sunday I set out from my house and headed east toward the highway. I went up, then hooked west back toward the high school. I stopped by my friends house and chatted a while, had a drink of water, then set out to continue my run.</p>
<p>I continued around town, avoiding the busy streets, and passing through all the interesting neighborhoods and byroads. By the time I returned home, I was totally exhausted. I was dizzy and weak. I drank gatorade and lay flat on the floor for a long while.</p>
<p>The next morning, I had a bad ache in my left shin. I recognized this to be a stress fracture, which I had been diagnosed with, and recovered from, in the past.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the following Tuesday. Our team was competing in a large regional track meet with a dozen or so other schools. I was the anchor in the 4x800m relay. My leg still ached badly, so I tightly wrapped it in a bandage, and tried to shake off the pain with some warm-up sprints and edgy 90s alternative rock.</p>
<p>The race begins. Our first three runners were very good, and when the baton came to me we were in 1st or 2nd place (as best I can recall). I set out around the first lap, and easily maintained our position. Right as I began the 2nd lap, something started to feel strange. I had an odd sensation in my left leg, and heard a strange grinding noise. It sounded like my track spikes had started to break off or come loose. I assumed this was the case, and I kicked extra hard around the first turn.</p>
<p>Just as I left the first turn, it happened. My tibia snapped right out from under me, and I fell flat on my face. In that moment, I had such a level of adrenaline and endorphins, that I didn&#8217;t feel anything at all. I tried to stand up, but my broken leg just buckled beneath me and I fell once again.</p>
<p>Still confused, I began to try to stand again. Before I could, a teammate had made it to me and explained what had happened. I sat in shock as all the other runners passed me.</p>
<p>As I limped to my car, a parent who was sitting in the audience called out to get my attention. He said that he could hear the bone break from where he was sitting in the bleachers. Still riding the endorphin high, I drove myself to the ER and had my leg set in a cast.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">Scraping Passwords from In-App Browsers</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>Last night I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry">Craig Hockenberry</a>&#8216;s excellent post that explains a method that an iOS app can use to capture anything you type into an in-app browser.</p>
<p>Almost three years ago, I reported another way to eavesdrop on users&#8217; keystrokes in an embedded browser (radar 10447976). It&#8217;s a much more rudimentary attack than Craig&#8217;s, but nevertheless it&#8217;s a means for this information to be harvested.</p>
<p>Here is a dead simple <a href="https://github.com/mmorris/iOSPasswordGrab">sample project</a> that illustrates the attack. There are two factors that come into play.</p>
<ol>
<li>In a password field, each character is shown to the user for a brief moment.</li>
<li>Apps are allowed to do a screen-grab of their own window.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the sample app. The twitter login page is loaded into a WebView.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-97 aligncenter" src="http://104.236.129.96/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15330888336_e40936b96c_z-169x300.jpg" alt="15330888336_e40936b96c_z" width="300" srcset="https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15330888336_e40936b96c_z-169x300.jpg 169w, https://mattmorris.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15330888336_e40936b96c_z.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the most recent character in my password is displayed as I type. Now, combine this with a fast firing timer that continually takes screengrabs of the web view, and voilà, you have the whole password. I was able to easily capture my entire Twitter password.</p>
<p>Now, you still have to piece the keystrokes together out of the screenshots, so it&#8217;s not the most elegant attack, but in the end you still have the information.</p>
<p>When I reported this to Apple in 2011, they replied and said that they didn&#8217;t see how this is a security issue. I guess I can understand, since it&#8217;s pretty roundabout. Still, it would be nice if web views were bulletproof and completely trustworthy.</p>
<p>I agree with Craig that web views are great for quick and dirty views of webpages that aren&#8217;t asking for sensitive information. Be wary of entering sensitive passwords into any <strong>app</strong>, even if it&#8217;s showing you a webpage that isn&#8217;t technically phishing.</p>

			<h2 class="post-title">Password-Less User Authentication</h2>		</a>
		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>I’m what you might call a client-side iOS programmer, but for my latest project I’ve decided to roll my own backend. I’ve been thinking about the authentication flow will be needed. I don’t want users to remember usernames/passwords, and I don’t really want to have to keep track of them.</p>
<p>Currently, for development, the backend just checks for a single unique token that the client must send with all requests. (Assume that I’m using SSL Pinning to ensure that I’m not connecting to a man in the middle.) This is okay when the app is just on my phone, but I can’t very well ship the app with the token embedded. Even if it’s obfuscated, there’s no guaranteed way to prevent someone from unearthing the token and making rogue API requests. And by rogue API request, I mean any API request that’s not a result of normal use of the app.</p>
<p>It really wouldn’t be the end of the world if this happened. The only consequences I can think of is my database filling up with junk, or maybe someone could try to brute force their way into getting some semi-sensitive data out of the API.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’d like to have some per-user, or per-device, token that I can use to authenticate API requests. I’m thinking of trying the following password-less approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>User is prompted to enter an email to sign up for an account. At this time, a unique token is generated and sent to the API along with the email address. Token is stored in the keychain on the device.</li>
<li>User is prompted to check his email to continue. Offer a button to open Mail.app, GMail.app, or another mail app that’s been detected.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, at the backend, an email is generated with a unique URL and sent to the user. Tapping this link will whitelist the token generated in (1), and kick the user back into the app.</li>
<li>From now on, whenever the app becomes active, it queries the API to test if the token is whitelisted. If a good token is not found in the keychain, then the app can go through the flow again to generate one. And this would give me a mechanism for blocking a token or email address that is acting suspiciously.
<li>
</ul>
<p>So this would let the app authenticate with the API without the need for a password. The downside is that the user will have to go through this flow on every new device. Perhaps I could store the token in iCloud to avoid that problem.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this a horrible idea? Could I somehow achieve this with OAuth?</li>
<li>Does it matter if the token is generated client-side or server-side?</li>
</ul

		<div class="post-subtitle">
							<p>It’s 8pm. The kids are asleep, and I just sat down at my desk to begin my day’s “work.” But I am so physically and mentally exhausted that instead I’m going to write this post and then go to sleep.</p>
<p>Where did my energy go? Well, today I cooked three meals for four people, taught “preschool” for two hours, took the kids for their annual doctor’s checkup, washed and put away two loads of laundry, played kickball in the street with the neighborhood kids, cleaned the kitchen three times, read stories for half the afternoon, bath time, bed time, Lego time, nap time, dinner time…</p>
<p>Being a stay-at-home parent is <strong>hard work</strong>. I have to actually <strong>listen</strong> to my kids and stay engaged. I have to <strong>put away</strong> my phone and interact with them. If I can’t keep up, challenging and stimulating them with new activities and experiences, then they get bored and ask to watch TV.</p>
<p>Today I calmly and quickly diffused a tantrum that, only two months ago, would have probably thrown me for a loop. I might even have gotten mad and raised my voice. Instead, I now have the mental and emotional energy to do better.</p>
<p>Oh, and it’s been several days since the kids have even <strong>asked</strong> to watch TV.</p>
<p>So what’s my response when asked about my decision to quit my job and become a full-time dad?</p>
<p>“<strong>Worth It.</strong>”</p>
